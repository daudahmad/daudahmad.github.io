This is my first post on my new blog! How exciting!

I've recently moved to Melbourne from Islamabad, Pakistan.

I thought I'd start with some good news from the world.

## Poverty decline over the years

In 1820, more than 90% of the world lived in extreme poverty and now it's around 10%.
This is pretty _incredible_ if you ask me.

## Death by famines over the years

Famines used to kill millions of people once upon a time but now we've almost fixed this problem for the most part.
**Amazing!**
